# odin-recipes

This project is a basic recipe website.  This will demonstrate creating a basic index.html page with boilerplate HTML code.  
From there the site will have a separate "recipes" directory with html pages that the index.html page will have links to.
The purpose of this website is to practice basic website structure and pushing changes through Git and Github.
